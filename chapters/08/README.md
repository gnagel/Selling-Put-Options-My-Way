# 08 - Three of the Most Common Questions

1. If this works so well, why doesn't everybody do it?
2. Why is someone buying the PUT's?
3. Can I sell PUT's in an IRA?

**Note:** 
The answers to these questions would be a little different today in 2022 than they were in 2010.
1. More people are trading options now because of platforms like Robinhood and YouTube 
2. Protecting against a market drop, we are currently going through a bumpy market in 2022 and stocks of all varieties are not performing as well.
3. Depends on the IRA, although normally you can't sell naked option contracts.
