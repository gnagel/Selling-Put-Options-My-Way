# 15 - Why Option Premiums Change in Price

This chapter is largely a review of time decay, an experienced option trader can skip this chapter.

Summary:
- Option premiums can change for two reasons: the stock price changes or time moves forward towards expiration (time decay).
- When the stock moves down (closer to a PUT strike) the price (premium) of the PUT contract goes up.
- When the stock moves up (further away from the PUT strike) the price (premium) of the PUT contract goes down.
- When the time starts to decay (closer to the expiration date) the price of the PUT or CALL contract goes down. 

A stock can move quickly up or down on a gap day (large up or down open vs the previous close).  
It is always best to take the money and close the position when possible.
