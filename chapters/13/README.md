# 13 - Analyzing a Previous Trade

This chapter is a review of the example GOOG trade using the new trading rules from Chapter 12. An experienced trader can skip this section as necessary.

Example Trade
- GOOG January leaps
- Current Price $290.
- Strike Price $220.  20% below is $230, but Mr. Lee opted to move down a strike for safety
- STO (sold to open) at $7.88 per contract @ 65x contracts <=> 7.68 * 100 * 65 <=> $49,920 premium
- BTC (buy to close) at $3.80 per contract 1mo later <=> 3.80 * 100 * 65 <=> $24,700 to close
- Net $49,920 - $24,700 <=> $25,220 profit after 1mo, 5mo remain on the contracts.
- Mr. Lee decided to close the position early, rather than wait the remaining 5mo, to reap the fast profits and reduce the risk of the position going against him.

**Note:**
- This chapter is a reminder to close the positions early when possible, and to take the profits when they are available.
- This is preferable to letting a position move against you and needing to close it out unfavorably.
