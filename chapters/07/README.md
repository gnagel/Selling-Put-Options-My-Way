# 07 - Who Should Sell Puts

At this point we are now getting to the meat of the book. This chapter is extremely brief, but it serves as a filter for who should or should not proceed:

- Only use funds you can afford to loose
- Understand the various risks with PUT options, and how to manage them
- Understand the factors that affect the pricing of a PUT option

Mr. Lee summarizes his experience after developing his rules as:
- Win 90% of trades
- Break even on 5% of trades
- Loose on 5% of trades

His performance results in 3-6% earnings per month.  Based off of a portfolio of $100k, this doubles in 2 years, 4x in 4 years, and 8x in 6 years.

**Notes**: 
- When selling a PUT the premium you are paid is your income.  
- For example, if you sell a put for $50 <=> $0.50 * 100 shares, then you made $50.
- The job of you, the seller, is to pick PUT's that have a low probability of being exercised, so you can keep as much of that $50 as possible.
