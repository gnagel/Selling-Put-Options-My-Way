# 06 - Buying and Selling Puts

Buying a PUT
- Buying a PUT gives you the right to sell the equity to someone else at the strike price.
- If the (underlying) equity is below the strike price at expiration, you can execute the PUT and pocket the delta.  For example strike=45, stock=42, profit=3 per contract * shares.
- If the (underlying) equity is above the strike price at expiration, then it expires worthless, and you don't make any profit.
- The opposite holds for selling a PUT.

Selling a PUT
- Selling a PUT gives you the right to obligation to purchase the equity at the strike price.
- If the (underlying) equity is below the strike price at expiration, the buyer can execute the PUT and you pay the delta.  For example strike=45, stock=42, loss=3 per contract * shares.
- If the (underlying) equity is above the strike price at expiration, then it expires worthless, and you pocket the profit from the inital sale.
