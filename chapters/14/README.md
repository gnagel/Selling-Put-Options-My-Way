# 14 - How to Avoid Problems While Selling Puts

**Note:** These are the rules for how to close a position and manage risk.

1. Use stops to prevent a disaster for your portfolio.
2. Stick to the two rules below for closing a position
   - Close when the premium 2x, if you were paid $0.30/contract and it's now $0.60/contract close the position at a loss
   - Close when the underlying equity drops to the strike price, if open=$50, strike=$40 then close it before the stock reaches the strike price. If the contract closes ITM (in-the-money) then you 
     will lose out significantly.
3. Maximum lifetime for any position is 30x days, close any position older than that. 
   - When buying an option contract (CALL or PUT) you want as much time as possible for the position to move in your desired direction. 
   - When selling an option contract (PUT or CALL) you want as little time as possible.
4. Assignment can happen, but it is very rare for OTM (out-of-the-money) positions. You will likely never be assigned a CALL or PUT contract that's not ITM.
