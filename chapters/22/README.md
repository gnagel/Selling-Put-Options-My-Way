# 22 - Where Do I Find the Stocks That I Use

This chapter is a description of how Mr. Lee tracks potential stock picks.
An experienced with a watchlist can skip this chapter.

Mr. Lee keeps a watch list of 100x stocks that he picks from to trade options. 
- When he learns of a new stock he will add it to his list if it has optional contracts and matches the general rules 
outlined in the previous chapters.
- When a stock Mr. Lee has been trading drops in volume, it may no longer be viable for selling PUTs.  Move on and pick a different stock

Directional:
- Selling a naked PUT is a BULLISH play, this means we expect the stock to stay at the same price or go up.
- Selling a naked CALL is a BEARISH play, this means we expect the stock to stay at the same price or go down.

Regardless of the direction, stick to the 3-6% rule and don't trade outside that range.
