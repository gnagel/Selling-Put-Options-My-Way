## How to pick a stock that fits

Mr. Lee maintains a list of 75-100 stocks that suit his strategy well. The contents of the list rotate, but the size is realtively stable.
Many of the stocks are the FANG style stocks: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc.

The key feature to look for is stocks that have enough volatility in their option premiums to be a good fit.

**Note:**

- Mr. Lee is indicating that he's looking for stocks with above average open interest.
- The filter we are looking for is above average premiums for out-of-the-money PUT contracts.

## Stock Filters:

1. Mr. Lee usually uses a stock in the $50-500 range. Below $50 & the relative move can quickly overtake your position. Above $500 there is no reason listed, but it's likely the lack of volume
   above this price range.
2. Strike price filter is 20%. Mr. Lee's filter is that the strike price of a PUT option must be at least 20% away from the current price of the equity. The general rule is to ROUND_DOWN
   (current_price % 0.80)
3. Avoid if there are earnings during the option's lifetime. Many companies will report earnings quarterly, this means that 4 months out of the year they are not something you can trade, honor
   this rule and avoid the stocks during this time.
4. Look back 2x years (min) to check for a pattern of monthly drops. If the stock has a pattern of dropping during a specific period, for instance a big-box chain may drop in the summer because the
   holiday season is many months away, then avoid the stock in those months.
5. Check the analyst recommendations. When the analysts are all bullish (uptrend), then it's a candidate for trading. When the analysts are bearish (downtrend), then it's out. As an addendum,
   avoid stocks that have a single factor pushing them, such as a biotech stock waiting on a single drug.
6. P/E (price to earnings) is king, the PE multiple is the number of years the company would need to grow in order to pay back the current equity price. The PE will tell you if a stock is
   overvalued or undervalued. A positive PE indicates a profitable company, but a NULL PE indicates an unprofitable company.  
   This is important because some companies can be skewed by financial tooling, e.g. AMZN @ 1000x PE.
7. Will the return of the position be covered by the maintenance cost of a position? For example, a $125 strike would require $1075 in maintenance and has a $0.75 premium, this results in a $0.
   75/10.75 <=> 0.069 return for the position. This is close enough to the target range of 3-6% that it's acceptable for the portfolio.
8. Open interest, if the O/I is less than 100 avoid it. This is a general rule for options traders since you want to avoid positions that have low volumes and can't be exited easily.

**TL;DR, Notes:**

Skip the PUT option if any of the following are a NO:

1. Is the stock within the allowed range [50,500], avoid if it is out of this range.
2. Is there earnings within the given option period, avoid the option.
3. Is there a history of downward price movement within the given option period, avoid when negative.
4. Is the analyst sentiment positive for the stock & industry, avoid when negative.
5. Is the P/E reasonable, avoid if it is overly inflated or too low for the industry.
6. Is the return for the position within the target range of 3-6% (premium / maintenance requirement) to cover the position, avoid when it is out of this range.
7. Is there 100x or Open Interest contracts, avoid if it is below this range.

For example:
- Portfolio $50k
- Each position is 25% of the portfolio balance, fully leveraged
- AMGN, Amgen, can have 27x contracts. 2700 * (42.5 * 10% + 0.25) <=> 2700 * (4.25 + 0.25) <=> $4.5 maintenance per share. ROUND_DOWN($50k * 0.25 / $4.50 / 100) <=> ROUND_DOWN($12.5k / $4.50 / 100)
  <=> 27x contracts.
- AMGN, max profit is $675 for 27x contracts, risking $114k in stock equity.
- AMGN, would need to fall 20% or more in the contract time.  This can be mitigated by managing the position with a stop to reduce the likelihood of a fatal outcome.
- A fatal trap would be to use 100% of the balance on a single position. This would result in a high degree of risk if the position went negative, and a high degree of risk if positive.

| Symbol | Price | Strike | Premium | Return % |
|--------|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| AMGN   | $54   | $42.5  | $0.25   | 5.88%    |
| PPP    | $63   | $50.0  | $0.20   | 3.80%    |
| ZZZ    | $95   | $75.0  | $0.35   | 4.45%    |
| MMM    | $36   | $27.5  | $0.15   | 5.17%    |
