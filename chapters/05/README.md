# 05 - Margin and Maintenance

This is a simplified overview of margin for stocks and options.  
An experienced trader can skip this chapter.

Stock Margin
- This is the amount of capital your broker will grant you to purchase stock that exceeds your cash in the account.
- For example, if you have $100 in the account your broker will match you $100, the result is you can purchase $200 worth of stock.
- NOTE: This works both ways, if the stock goes up you can keep the position, but if the stock goes down you may get a margin call and be forced to sell some or all of the stock

Option Margin, Maintenance
- Each option position will have some overhead to it.  This is called the maintenance cost for the position.
- The idea here is that we set aside a portion of the cash in your account to cover the given position.
- This is broker dependent, but the general rules are that you will need the highest of either calculation
- - Some percentage of the current price - premium received
- - Some percentage of the strike price - premium received
- There are numerous calcualtors for it, but you should consult your broker(s) to understand how much capital (cash) you need to set asside for each position you want to open.

The key point of this section is that hte `Option Margin Maintenance` will change as the position moves around.
If the position becomes less valuable you need less margin, and the opposite when it increases in value.
