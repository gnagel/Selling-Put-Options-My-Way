# 25 - Summary

**Rules:**
1. Do not get greedy (stick to the 3-6% ratio of premium / maintenance)
2. Use mostly stocks in the $50 - $500 range (too low and there's not enough volume, too high & it can fall faster than you can catch)
3. Use a strike price 20% or MORE below the current price (for PUTs, CALLs are 20%+ more)
4. Make sure no major news is upcoming: earnings, mergers, splits, dividends, acquisitions
5. A history of good price movement during this annual period (look back several years to compare seasonal price action)
6. Use stocks that have BUY recommendations from the analyst(s) (the more bullish the analysis is the more the stock tends to go up, which is good for PUT contracts)
7. Use stocks with a reasonable P/E (make sure the valuation of the stock makes sense for what they do & their industry)
8. Do not let looses run away from you (stick to the rules and close out a position early, rather than letting it run and wiping you out)
9. Never hesitate to take profits or losses when there are doubts about a position (if there is a profit to be made now, it's better than a loss to be made later)
10. Be suspicious if the premiums are "too good" (stick to the 3-6% ratio of premium / maintenance, if it's more than this move to a differient strike or stock)
