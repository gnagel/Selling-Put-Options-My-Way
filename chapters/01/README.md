# 1 - My Investing History

This is a very short chapter that describes the author.

He started out with a small amount of money around the time of the Internet Bubble and learned his lessons the hard way, in the school of hard knocks taught by the market.

Mr. Lee has a specific style of investing that he has learned over time, he finds it a useful way of making some money which may benefit the intrepid trader.

His style of trading different from the standard buy and hold, but it does have rules which will be outlined in future chapters as we work through the book.

The general idea is to track a few items monthly & use this to make simple trades for "free money" from the market.
