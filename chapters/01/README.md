# 1 - My Investing History

Mr. Lee started out in the 90's with ~150k USD in his account. He accumulated this via various means including a second job, investing in some apartment buildings, and a retirement package from vacation pay. 

At first his stock picks weren't doing well, however after starting on options for some high-flying names like MSFT, AMZN, DELL, etc he caught the wave and printed money quickly on these 
stocks that just couldn't go down. After an unstoppable run he was able to take rather expensive vacations and purchase several vehicles.Overall his success was moving hin forward quickly and 
swiftly towards a killer portfolio from 150k-2M USD in 4x years.

Unfortunately this didn't last as 1999-2000 came around and the Internet Bubble peaked and fell. Mr. Lee was selling PUTs at or near the current strike with few to no trading rules, and 
predictably he was hit with margin calls. After a severe battering over the following two years Mr. Lee took a step back to take inventory of his situation and come up with some trading rules for 
now to proceed forward.

_Self Notes_:
- Mr. Lee's style is highly risky and not stable for most investors.
- Mr. Lee utilizes PUT options as the primary tool in his style
- Mr. Lee couldn't attribute his style to a specific book or method, he appears to have a home-grown style that will require extensive back testing and verification.
