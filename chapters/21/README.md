This chapter is a reminder of some risks you will experience as an option trader.
An experienced option trader can skip this chapter.

**Notes: Red flags you should be wary of & avoid trading**
1. If there is an upcoming stock split, skip the position.
2. If the stock is a candidate for a merger or acquisition, skip the position.
3. If there are no options with sufficient premiums ratios (premium / maintenance requirement), skip the position.
4. If the stock continues to go up, so you would pick a riskier strike for more premium, skip the position.
5. If the conditions are perfect and there is a large premium, skip the position. and 
6. If the stock and premium have dropped through the close trigger, but you want to hold on longer, close the position.
7. If your instincts are to close the position, but you want to hold on longer, close the position.

Not following these rules is the equivalent of gambling without a system.
