# 16 - Bid and Ask

This chapter is largely a review of bid-ask spread, an experienced option trader can skip this chapter.

Summary:
- If the money is too good, just skip it.
- If the premium/maintenance is over 6% then move on.
- There are always extrinsic factors (things outside your control or knowledge), this means there is someone else who knows more than you, so you should be wary of when they are offering too much 
  money.
- Watch out for dividend payments within the option period. This will move the price up or down depending on the amount and cannot be predicted.

**Note:**
- In addition to the rules before, skip dividend and earnings option periods.
